DS-17 Daily Warm Ups
====================

Welcome to DS17! This is the repository you will use to complete your
daily warm up challenges throughout your first four units here at Lambda.
This is a living document and will be updated as you progress throughout
the course. The primary goals here are to help you become more familiar
with Python in general and the git workflow, while reinforcing the
core curriculum you are being taught. I hope that you find the
information contained here useful and conducive to your learning experience
here.

Hello World!
