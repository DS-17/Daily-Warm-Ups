Unit 1

Good Morning.

For your first warm-up, post in the ds17 to partner up with another
student. You and this student should fork the repository and in here
you will find the first notebook titled `basics`. Work with your partner
to finish the notebook. When you're done send a copy of the notebook
to your TL.

Day 2
-----

Breakout into your respective TL groups, one of you should start a zoom call
and post the link so your teammates can join.

Further instructions for the days warm up can be found in

Good luck!
